# Questions

## 1. Describe your experience with consuming APIs in a frontend application. 
-  I have good knowledge on how to consume APIs 

## 2. What methods have you used for making requests, and how have you handled responses, especially errors?
- I have used React-Query, Next SWR, Redux thunk and useEffect hook. 
I personally like React-Query, because of some of the features that comes with it such as loading state, error handling, caching, cache revalidation etc
in react-query one can easily handle a response from an api like this

```js
const {loading, error, data} = useQuery('', )
```

## 3. What are some of the best practices you follow when working with React and Next.js? 

## 4. Can you give some examples from your past projects?

## 5. In your own words, explain the concept of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and how it is implemented in Next.js.

## 6. Why is it important?
